# DiceVisualize

A dice probability visualization site for CoC &amp; DnD dices

## Problem settings

When playing CoC & DnD, we often need to roll dices to determine the outcome of an action. However, human brain is not good at calculating the probability of the sum of multiple dices.

## Solution

This is a website that visualize the probability of the sum of multiple dices and some constants

We want to analyze the distribution of the sum of multiple dices with some constants.

### Monte Carlo Method

Monte Carlo method is a computational technique that uses random numbers to solve mathematical problems. It is named after the Monte Carlo Casino in Monaco, where chance and randomness are central to the gameplay.

We generate a draw from our desired distribution by using sun of independent draws. This would be used to evaluate correctness of our algorithm.

### Combinatorial Mathematics

It is possible to get the direct distribution of dice rolls by enumeration with combinatorics.

The evaluation goes as follows:
